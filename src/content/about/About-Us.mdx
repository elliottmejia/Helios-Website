## OUR MISSION

To rebuild the United States to run solely off of clean renewable energy.

## OUR STORY

Helios, the Greek God of the Sun. He was thought to ride a golden chariot which brought the Sun across the skies each day from east to west. Although we don’t have any chariots, we were founded on the ideals of being responsible for our World’s life, just like Helios. We intend to make a difference for our planet, and for our clients. We strive to set ourselves apart by providing a different solar experience: Simple, Smooth, and Saving money for all of our clients. Both founders came directly from the Solar industry and have an extensive background in entrepreneurship and customer service.

## HOW WE WORK

Every company will tell you they’re the best…\
How can you ever really ever know? We’ve found a way.

What we’ve done is partner with multiple different installers. Some doing $10M in business annually, others doing over $100M. By using multiple installers it allows us to ‘shop’ the market for you and always be able to best serve our clients with what’s available.

Whichever of our premier installers is offering the best deal at the time, we start there. If after meeting with you we determine it could be advantageous for you and us to use a different installer, then we do just that.
