# CA REBATES ENTIRE COST OF BATTERY STORAGE SYSTEMS FOR HIGH FIRE THREAT DISTRICTS (HFTD) RESIDENTS

3/16/20 Los Angeles, CA - The California SGIP (Self Generation Incentive Program) was refunded Monday morning with $9,000,000 allocated to covering the entire cost of backup battery systems for residential homeowners who:

1. Live in a ‘High Fire Threat District’ tier 3 or 2.
2. OR were subject to two Public Safety Power Shutoffs.

If meeting either of the above requirements, to qualify for the funds residents must also:

1. Rely on electric pump wells for water.
2. OR Medical Baseline customers.
3. OR A customer that has notified their utility of serious illness or condition that could become life-threatening if electricity is disconnected.

Since **the vast majority of HIGH FIRE THREAT DISTRICT (HFTD) residents may qualify for the program** through (1), and (A,B, or C) this is an unprecedented moment to be able to equip your house to always have electricity, even if the grid goes down or the power gets shut off. With Two-Three batteries, **HFTD** residents can back up their entire house and never worry about not having power. Anyone that can qualify should seize the moment before the funding runs out.

A solar energy system is required in order to charge the batteries, thankfully that system can be completely financed as well for nothing down, and less per month than most **HFTD** residents are currently paying for their electric bill. That means each month, a qualifying resident who financed their solar system and previously paid $200 per month for electricity for example, would now pay roughly $150 per month to own their solar system, and pay almost nothing for electricity. Combining solar & the SGIP program would allow them to not only save money, but have off-grid electricity and never worry about power outages again.

# Produce Your Own Clean Energy

Solar panels produce renewable clean energy eliminating your electric bill while simultaneously reducing your carbon footprint.

Our sun gives off continuous energy that hits our planet. Solar panels capture that energy converting it into electricity that can be used in your home.

That's 10,000 times more power than the planet's population uses. So is it possible that one day the world could be completely reliant on solar energy? Richard Komp examines how solar panels convert solar energy to electrical energy.
